## Running the app

- Install nodejs.
- Navigate to the directory with these files and run the following command

```bash
# install the dependencies
npm install
```

- Run the app

```bash
# run the application
npm start
```

## Setup

The `.env` file contains two configurations that need to be set in order to work correctly

- `PATH_TO_FILES` - This should be the path to the folder containing all the linear files
- `PATH_TO_OUTPUT` - This should be the output path of the excel files that are generates

**The paths specified above must exist already on your filesystem or very bad things will happen :(**
